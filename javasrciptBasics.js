//Including JavaScript in an HTML Page
//To include JavaScript inside a page, you need to wrap it in <script> tags:

<script type="text/javascript">

//JS code goes here

</script>

//Call an External JavaScript File
//You can also place JavaScript in its own file and name it inside your HTML. 
//That way, you can keep different types of code separate from one another,
// making for better-organized files. 
// If your code is in a file called myscript.js, you would call it:

<script src="myscript.js"></script>
